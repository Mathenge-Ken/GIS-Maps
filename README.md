# Chloropleth Map Displaying Population Density

## Project Overview
This project involved creating a chloropleth map to visualize population density using GeoPandas in Python. The visualization process included merging geographical and demographic data and applying various techniques to enhance the map's aesthetics and readability.

## Skills Learned
- **Geospatial Data Visualization**: Gained experience in visualizing geospatial data using GeoPandas and Matplotlib.
- **Data Merging**: Learned to merge a GeoDataFrame with a pandas DataFrame to link population data accurately with geographical shapes.
- **Population Density Calculation**: Developed skills to calculate population density by utilizing land area attributes to ensure accuracy.
- **Customization Techniques**: Explored options for customizing maps, including:
  - Color-coding polygons based on population density.
  - Creating personalized legends for better clarity.
  - Adjusting visual elements such as axes, colors, and legend positioning.
- **High-Resolution Mapping**: Learned techniques to generate high-resolution maps and zoom capabilities for detailed analysis.

## Techniques Used
- **GeoPandas**: Utilized GeoPandas for simple map plotting and spatial data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed Matplotlib for color ramps and customized visual features.
- **Choropleth Mapping**: Implemented choropleth mapping techniques for effective representation of population density.
